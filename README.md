# Decrypting-An-Encrypted-Message

## Project Description  
Complete a series of tasks to obtain instructions for decrypting an encrypted file. Encryption of data in use, at rest, and in transit is critical to security functions.

## Read The Contents Of A File
Using the **ls** command to list the files in the current working directory, two files, **Q1.encrypted** and **README.txt**, and a *subdirectory*, *caesar*, are listed:

The **README.txt** file contains an important message with instructions to follow. The **cat** command to list the contents of the **README.txt** file.
The message in the **README.txt** file advises that the *caesar* subdirectory contains a hidden file.

## Find A Hidden File
This task is to find a hidden file in the home directory and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contains.

The **cd** command was first used to change to the *caesar* subdirectory of your home directory. Then the **ls -a** command to list all files, including hidden files, in the home directory.
